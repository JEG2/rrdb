= Installing RRDB

RubyGems is the preferred easy install method for RRDB.  However, you can
install RRDB manually as described below.

== Installing the Gem

RRDB is intended to be installed via the
RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] system.  To get the latest
version, simply enter the following into your command prompt:

	$ sudo gem install JEG2-rrdb -s http://gems.github.com

You must have RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] installed for
the above to work.

== Installing Manually

Download the latest version of RRDB from the
{GitHub project page}[http://github.com/JEG2/rrdb].  Navigate to the root
project directory and enter:

	$ sudo ruby setup.rb

== Running the Tests

If you would like to run RRDB's test suite on your system before installing and
you have Rake installed, just issue the following command from the root of the
project directory:

  $ rake

If you do not have Rake, use the following command instead:

  $ ruby -I lib:test test/ts_all.rb
